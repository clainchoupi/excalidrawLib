Excalidraw is a "Virtual whiteboard for sketching hand-drawn like diagrams".<br>
You can go to https://excalidraw.com to start sketching.<br>
I wanted to use it for other stuff than just playing and drawing random shapes.
So here is a first contribution (I will use these for later blog articles, stay tuned ^^)


## My custom icons and logos
Here is a sample of the logos you can find in the library. Feel free to use them!

## :thinking: How to use these icons ?
In a new Excalidraw window : 
- Click on "9 Library"
- Click on the Folder icon
- Select the "excalidrawLib\assets\importAsLib\logosAsLib.excalidrawlib" file from this project
- Start using the icons !! Et voila :)
